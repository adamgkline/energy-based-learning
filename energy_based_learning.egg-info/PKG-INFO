# Energy-Based Learning Framework

This repository aims at developing code for simulating energy-based systems and the training process of such systems using learning algorithms like equilibrium propagation. In particular, this repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the following papers:
- [Energy-based learning algorithms for analog computing: a comparative study](papers/ebl-algorithms/README.md)
- [A fast algorithm to simulate nonlinear resistive networks](papers/fast-drn/README.md)
- [A universal approximation theorem for nonlinear resistive networks](papers/universal-drn/README.md)


## Installation

### Using pip (Recommended)

You can install the package directly using pip:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rain-neuromorphics/energy-based-learning.git
```

Or for local development:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/rain-neuromorphics/energy-based-learning
cd energy-based-learning
pip install -e .
```

This will automatically install all required dependencies including PyTorch, Torchvision, and TensorBoard.

## Usage

Once installed, you can import the package in your Python code:

```python
import energy_based_learning as ebl

# Or import specific modules
from energy_based_learning.datasets import load_dataloaders
from energy_based_learning.model.resistive.network import DeepResistiveEnergy
from energy_based_learning.training.sgd import EquilibriumProp
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install dependencies manually:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/rain-neuromorphics/energy-based-learning
cd energy-based-learning
pip install torch torchvision tensorboard numpy
```

Then either install the package with `pip install -e .` or export the path to the main directory:
``` bash
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/the/main/directory"
```
